# Code of conduct


We are in this together: 

We work together 

respectfully, 

engaging

in a compassionate way.

The organisers of the Project LOVE gathering are committed to providing a safe, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of class, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices... We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. The gathering participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers.

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants, including organisers and applies to all modes of interaction, both in-person and online.

The participants the Project LOVE gathering agree to:

  * Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; unwelcome sexual attention; deliberate 'outing' of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent; misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names; and publication of non-harassing private communication.
  * Take care of each other. Alert a member of the Committee if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.



## Need Help?

The first point of contact regarding anything relevant for the Code of Conduct is Giulio. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please talk or email Giulio. You may also email to any other member of Project LOVE, reach out to them individually or, if it is an emergency, the UC campus security.

If any attendee engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any lawful action they deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the conference. (If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should report it with a concise description of your grievance.)

We thank you for working with us to make the gathering of Project LOVE a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
